# Laser / Flashlight

This item provides a combination laser and flashlight attachment for your weapon to facilitate aiming and visibility, similar to the real-life [AN/PEQ-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/PEQ-2). The module can be toggled between flashlight mode, laser mode, or both.

Human-type enemies (undead, jackboots, and marines) can use the flashlight and/or laser sight in darker areas, which may make them easier to spot. Using the NVGs will also make all lasers significantly more visible than with the naked eye.

# Markers

Whether used to mark cleared rooms or temporarily shed some light on a dim situation, glowsticks and flares are simple but useful tools in the right circumstances. They're also small enough that even a high-speed-low-drag can afford to carry a few, just in case.

The flares are small but reasonably bright, and burn correspondingly quicky. Use these for short-term illumination, or marking static targets for supporting fire..

Glowsticks are dimmer than flares but last much longer. As such, these are useful for marking cleared rooms or points of interest. If a team brought enough, a trail of glowing tubes could even be used as breadcrumbs in a complex space or open terrain to aid backtracking. While green is the preferred color among most units, scuttlebutt suggests R&D may be working on other chemical formulations.
